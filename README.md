## üõ† Step-by-Step Interaction with Jovi (Chatbot Simulation)

### Step 1: Initial Troubleshooting Conversation
We begin by asking a standard question:  
**‚ÄúHave you restarted your router, and does that help?‚Äù**  
Jovi responds with:  
> "When I restart the router, some devices connect to the internet and some don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not always the same devices that connect."

### Step 2: Narrowing Down the Issue
We then ask if the same number of devices connect each time, helping to isolate the DHCP assignment issue.

### Step 3: Identify Peripheral Device Issues
We explore whether the issue involves internet-enabled printers and the frustration the user faces.

---

### Step 4: Investigating IP Assignment
We ask Jovi if they assigned static IPs, helping us rule out potential conflicts. We confirm DHCP is being used.

---

### Step 5: Remote Access for Troubleshooting
We remotely access the user‚Äôs device using **Google Chrome Remote Desktop** and review the router settings via SSH.

## üîß Solution
We identify that the router‚Äôs **IP address pool** was too small. The default range (198.168.1.10 to 198.168.1.20) could not support all user devices. We increase the range to:
```
198.168.1.10 ‚Üí 198.168.1.100
```

## ‚úÖ Result
- Connectivity issues resolved
- Verified fix via SSH access
- Closed ticket with summary report

## üîë Skills Demonstrated
- Remote Desktop Support
- Network Troubleshooting (DHCP & IP conflicts)
- IT Support Communication
- SSH & Router Configuration

## üîê Accessing the Router via SSH for DHCP Inspection

After narrowing down the cause to DHCP limits, we accessed the router using **SSH** for deeper inspection.

### Step 6: Launch Command Prompt
![Start CMD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122gMdioPfp-Gv47VsS0pHSep2gHBHQer/view?usp=drive_link)
![Run Command](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PctkUwg8dR9-ThxKOEO2DApLErU1inB/view?usp=drive_link)

### Step 7: Connect to the Router via SSH
We ran the following command to initiate a secure shell session:
```bash
ssh admin@192.168.1.1
```

### Step 8: Retrieve DHCP Configuration
Once connected, we used:
```bash
nvram get dhcp_start
nvram get dhcp_end
```
To fetch the current IP address allocation range.

![Check End IP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2d0sD0s2uRhItna8MLlFE08ASUWrdJs/view?usp=drive_link)

## üîß Solution Applied

We confirmed that the IP pool was too small to serve all devices. Using the web router interface, we updated the DHCP range:

**Before:**  
Start: `192.168.1.2`  
End: `192.168.1.10`  

**After:**  
End expanded to `192.168.1.100`

## ‚úÖ Resolution and Closing Chat

We verified that all devices could now connect to the network and followed up with the user to confirm resolution.

## üèÅ Final Outcome

The issue was resolved through:
- Careful communication
- Remote access and troubleshooting
- DHCP inspection via SSH and router interface

This hands-on experience strengthened my skills in technical analysis, customer support, and remote problem-solving.
